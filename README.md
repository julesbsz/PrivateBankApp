# Private Bank App

The app is currently under development and is not yet ready for use in production.
Private Bank is an open source & self-hosted banking app that helps you keep track of your expenses.

## How does it work?

I grew tired of tracking my expenses using an Excel sheet, which often led to errors (mostly due to deferred payments and laziness). That's why I created this app. The app is designed to be as user-friendly as possible. Each time you make an expense, you open the app and click the + button. You then add your expense type (income or expense) and the amount. You can also set a percentage of your total account amount that you want to save each month, so you will always know how much you can still spend.

## Features

- Total account amount
- Add income/expense
- Remaining expense before exceeding authorized threshold
- Transaction history
- And more

## Design

The design was created using Figma. Most of the UI elements used have been designed by [PixelPrem](www.pixelprem.com). You can find the Figma Design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Q8W4CxEouycXScVsgPgfdN/Bank-App?type=design&node-id=12%3A3159&mode=design&t=B3LxFvbHHrapdWDP-1).

## Stack & Tools

The entire app is built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). The database used for authentication and storing user data is [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/), a simple database that you can host in a moment on your server. Check this link for more info.
